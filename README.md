# Simple-Linear-Regression-In-R

 We use linear regression to predict the value of an outcome variable Y based on one or more input predictor variables X.
 The aim is to establish a linear relationship (a mathematical formula) between the predictor variable(s) and the response variable, 
 so that, we can use this formula to estimate the value of the response Y, 
 when only the predictors (Xs) values are known.
